### Scenario
You are a data engineer hired by an ecommerce company named SoftCart.com . The company retailsdownload only items like E-Books, Movies, Songs etc. The company has international presence andcustomers from all over the world. You have designed the schema for the data warehouse in the previousassignment. Data engineering is a team game. Your senior data engineer reviewed your design. Your schemadesign was improvised to suit the production needs of the company. In this assignment you will generatereports out of the data in the data warehouse.
### Objectives
In this assignment you will:
- Load data into Data Warehouse
- Write aggregation queries
- Create MQTs
Throughout this lab you will be prompted to take screenshots and save them on your owndevice. You will need these screenshots to either answer graded quiz questions or to upload asyour submission for peer review at the end of this course. You can use various freescreengrabbing tools to do this or use your operating systemâ€™s shortcut keys to do this (forexample Alt+PrintScreen in Windows).
### About the dataset

2. Start the PostgreSQL server.
3. Create a new database named "Test1".
4. Create the following tables:
   - DimDate
   - DimCategory
   - DimCountry
   - FactSales

### Task 3 - Load data into the dimension table DimCountry

- [Download data](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0321EN-SkillsNetwork/datawarehousing/DimCountry.csv)
- Load the data into the DimCountry table.
- Take a screenshot of the first 5 rows in the DimCountry table and name it `DimCountry.jpg`.

### Task 4 - Load data into the fact table FactSales

- [Download data](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0321EN-SkillsNetwork/datawarehousing/FactSales.csv)

- Take a screenshot of the first 5 rows in the FactSales table and name it `FactSales.jpg`.

## Queries for Data Analytics

### Task 5 - Create a grouping sets query

Create a grouping sets query using the columns country, category, totalsales. Take a screenshot of the SQL query and the output rows. Name the screenshot `groupingsets.jpg`.

### Task 6 - Create a rollup query

Create a rollup query using the columns year, country, and totalsales. Take a screenshot of the SQL query and the output rows. Name the screenshot `rollup.jpg`.

### Task 7 - Create a cube query
